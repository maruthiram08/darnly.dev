# Bug on /: whole page

**Expected:** links squashed

**Window:** 1280x860 CSS pixels (desktop width). The bug was seen at this width: look at the page and check your fix at 1280px wide, because layout bugs often show only at some widths.

Page title: "Pebble Store"

## Steps before this (the user's last action on this site)
Recorded automatically. They may include steps that have nothing to do with the bug. What the user typed is never recorded, only where.
1. Opened `/`

Whole visible page captured (no single element picked).

No console errors or failed requests in the last 60 seconds.

## How to fix
If the note is vague or compares to something else ("like the other pages", "like the Beliefs pills"), look at that part of the code first and match it. If it is still unclear, ask the user one short question before changing anything.
Find the code with the hints above, fix it so the expected behaviour happens, then move this file and the other files that start with 2026-11-09-1910-links-squashed to .darnly/done/.

## How to check it's fixed
After fixing, check it yourself if you can open a browser (Claude in Chrome, the Chrome DevTools MCP, Playwright or similar):
1. Open `http://localhost:46043/` (start the dev server first if it isn't running) with the page (viewport) set to 1280x860, the size the user had. Set the width exactly: a few pixels can cross a breakpoint.
2. Look at the whole visible page.
3. Check that the **Expected** line is now true. The screenshot shows how it looked before.
If it still looks wrong, fix it again. If you can't open a browser, say so instead of guessing. End your **Fixed:** line with "(checked in the browser)" when you did.
